# Scala

# Scala is statically typed

Scala is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object.

# Functional and object-oriented

Scala is also a functional language in the sense that every function is a value.

# Scala is highly brevity

Scala is highly brevity meaning less code
when the lines of code got reduced we call that brevity.

# Scala is faster than java

1. New version of java
   So if we have currently java 1.5 and then upgrade to java 1.8,
   The 1.8 will obviously will be faster.
   So we can say that scala is a new version of java.

2. Brevity (less line of code)
   Brevity, less line of code meaning less byte code, and better performance
3.
