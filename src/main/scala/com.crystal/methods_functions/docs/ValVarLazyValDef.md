# Functions

We can say that functions are named reusable Expression blocks
that can have parameters.

- [Val Var LazyVal Def](../VarValLazyValDef.sc)

# Val

- stands for value
- Immutable
- Permit modification

A val modifier is immutable, is value cannot be changed once it has
been assigned

# Var
  - Stands for variable
  - mutable

# Def
The def keyword is used to define methods which are evaluated each time
they are invoked
 

# Lazy val
- immutable
- it is evaluated the first time it is referenced in the code
- Assignment happens only once
This lazy val is not evaluated at the time of assignment, but 
when we reference the lazy val there is when the assignment will be 
evaluated
